## News-Category-Counting--MapReducer
This project implements a Hadoop MapReduce job to process a cleaned news dataset and extract statistical insights based on news categories. The goal is to count the frequency of each unoque category using separate MApper and Reducer Python scripts.

The project demonstrates:
* Text processing with Hadoop MapReduce.
* Working with HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File Syetem)
* Parcing large-scale JSON-derived data
* Counting and sorting news article categories efficiently.

# Dataset
The dataset is a newsCategoryDataset form https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset. This News_Category_dataset_V3.json json dataset file was converted in to txt within New_Cleaned.txt using convert_json_to_text.py.
