## News-Category-Counting---MapReducer
This project implements a Hadoop MapReduce job to process a cleaned news dataset and extract statistical insights based on news categories. The goal is to count the frequency of each unoque category using separate MApper and Reducer Python scripts.

The project demonstrates:
* Text processing with Hadoop MapReduce.
* Working with HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File Syetem)
* Parcing large-scale JSON-derived data
* Counting and sorting news article categories efficiently.

# Dataset
The dataset is a newsCategoryDataset form
